## Built with
This project uses the following software:
- OpenGL
- freeglut
- GLEW
- libGLU

## How to Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need Git, a C compiler, Make and all the above libraries.
When everything is installed, you can run it from the command line:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/vittoboa/solar-system.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd solar-system

# Compile the app
$ make

# Run the simulation
$ ./start
```

## Motivation
This is not meant to be realistic, I have built it to teach myself OpenGL fundamentals.
